# AIoT Beehive Monitoring System

This repository hosts our AIoT Beehive Monitoring project, aiming to enhance beekeeping with AI and IoT. Our web application provides insights into hive health, bee counting, and wasp detection using image classification and object detection. We explore diverse approaches, including [BeeAlarmed project](https://github.com/BeeAlarmed/BeeAlarmed) integration and YOLOv7 deployment, showcasing the potential of AI in beekeeping.
